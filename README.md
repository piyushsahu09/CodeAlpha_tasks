# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the selling price of cars based on various features such as
present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, and ownership history.
Completed as part of the CodeAlpha Internship.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes 301 car records with attributes like:
- Present Price
- Driven Kilometers
- Fuel Type
- Transmission
- Owner Count

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model
- Linear Regression

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Present price has the highest impact on selling price
- Newer cars have higher resale value
- Automatic and diesel cars are priced higher
- Model achieved ~88% accuracy (R² score)
